11. libens patria careret. Merivale (c. 45) writes: ‘ Harsh,
indeed, and unreal the historian's phrase may appear to our notions,
to abandon one's country, thus applied to a citizen quitting the
walls of Rome to reside in a suburban retreat on the coast of
Campania. Doubtless we may trace in it something of an affecta-
tion of antique sentiment, from which Tacitus is by no means
always exempt.‘

between science and imposture.' Cf. Tac. dial. 30 anqustis et
breuibus terminis clauditur.
