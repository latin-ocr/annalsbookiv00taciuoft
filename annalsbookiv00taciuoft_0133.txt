17. exuere, se understood. exuo is a favourite metaphor
with Tacitus. Cf. c. 21.

satis aestmare. ‘This is not the same thing as satis existi-
mare; at least, I can find no undoubted instance of the use of
aestimare in the sense of ‘thinking' Tacitus always, I think,
uses the word in the sense of ‘valuing‚’ ‘rating‚’ ‘appraising'....
The sense here therefore is that Sejanus valued at its full worth
the security obtained for his family by the proposed arrangement.
He gave the proper value to it, and, so to say, did not want more
for his money' [P.F.]. He refers to these and other passages:
Ayric. 40 magnos uiros per ambitionem aestimare; Germ. 6 in
wztuersum aestimanti; xii 42 an ymnius aestimandum?

19. multum superque, the only instance of this expression.
satis superque (c. 38) is a common phrase.

20. quod...exp1euisset, ‘completed while such an Emperor
still reigned.’

So in Cioero's Letters ‘I have not committed myself' is expressed
several times in slightly varying phrase: omnia sunt integra—in
inteyro res nobis est—mihi inteyrum estsacere aut nonfacere. Cf. acl
Art. ix 2 ii quibus [ntegrum est, qui nondum ad honores accesserunt.

adiunxit, i.e. in a second letter.

4. in eo stare consilia, ‘their deliberations depended on the
question...’.

6. praecipua rerum, ‘important business? See c. 5.

ad famam dirigenda, ‘must be guided with a view to public
opinion.’ Cf. Tac. cle or. 5 ad utilitatem diriqenda.

7. promptum rescript-m, ‘the obvious answer.' Cf. Hist.
ii 76 promptum effectu.

8. nubendum...tolerandum haberet, ‘whether she should
