1. eodem anno Frisii. Bury’s paraphrase (Studenc‘s Roman
Empire, p. 185) is a good commentary on this chapter :—‘ Against
a revolt of tributaries on the northern boundary of the Empire,
the arms of Rome were not so successful. The Frisians‚ who had
been subdued by Drusus in 12 B.c.‚ had for forty years paid the
tribute which he had imposed on them. This tribute consisted
in ox-hides, which were required for military purposes3 and the
Officers who levied it never examined too curiously the size or
thickness of the skins, until in 28 ΑΗΒ. Olennius, a primipilar
centurion, who was appointed to exact the tribute, chose 1110
hides of wild bulls as the standard. As the domestic cattle of
the Germ-ans were of small size, the F risians found the innova-
tion hard. In order to meet the demands of Olennius, they were
forced to give up, first their capital, then their lands, finally 10
surrender their wives and children as pledges. As their complaints
led to no redress, they rose in revolt. The soldiers‚ who were
collecting the tribute, were impaled on gibbets3 and Olennius
himself was obliged to escape to the forti-ess of Flevum—probably
in the island of the same name, now Vlieland, near the Texel—
which was a Roman coastguard station.'
