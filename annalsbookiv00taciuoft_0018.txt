xiv TACITUS, ANNALS IV

dramatic power, terse epigram, stately dignity, and a stimu-
lating vigour natural in the first orator of the day. When he
found that the style he had created was effective and popular,
he adopted it permanently.

Tacitus is above all things an artist. Racine, quoted by
Boissier (p. 68), calls him the greatest painter of antiquity3
and ‘some of the pictures he has left are among the finest
surviving to us from ancient writers. ...... Professional men
charge him with defective information as to topography,
number of combatants, distribution of troops, phases of the
struggle. But let some novel or curicus episode intervene3
and at once the narrative is again brisk, interesting, and full
of colour' (Boissier, p. 69).

Similarly Livy is fond of ‘pleasant little resting-places,' as
he says in ix. 17, itt...leyerztib2cs uelut deuerticula amoena et
requiem animo meo quaererem. Tacitus' love of variety of
expression is very remarkable. Note how in iv 5 (a mere
catalogue of provinces and legions> Tacitus constantly varies
the forn] of expression. His frequent variety of syntax is
well illustrated by iv 38:-—quod aliz· modestiam, multi quia
diffideret, quidam vt deyenerz's (mimi intespretabuntur. His
vocabulary is largely made up of poetical words ; and there
are many echoes of Virgilian expression : see these examples
from Book IV:

nobis in arto et inglorius labor (32)
in tenui lab0r; at tenuis non gloria (Geor'q. iv 6)

quibus infaustae amicitiae grauis exitus imminebat (74)
nunc manet insontem grauis exitus (Aen. x630)

ualido cum remige (5)

agit acri remige (Aen. v 116).
