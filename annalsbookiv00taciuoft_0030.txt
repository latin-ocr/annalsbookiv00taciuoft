xxvi TACITUS, ANNALS IV

See T arver, l. 6., p. 304 :-——‘The history of the lex maiestatis
is not absolutely clear3 but it is certain that comparatively
early in the Republican period the laws provided for the
punishment of a Roman citizen who by his acts diminished
the majesty of the Republic. Cowardice in the field, prema-
ture surrender, dishonourable breaches of faith by which the
dignity of the State was impaired, were deeds punishable
under this law.7

Under Tiberius maiestas gained far-reaching importance.
He employed it for his own security. Any insult offered to
the Emperor in speech or writing was brought under the
statute. By its means he thwarted any latent opposition
among the senators, who were led to fear that any hostility
to the new regime might be looked upon as treason.

ln iv 6 Tacitus says that the laws were well administered
except proceedings for treason (omcz'estatz's quaestio). In iv 19 it
is stated that Silius and his wife could easily have been con-
demned on charges of repetnndae (extortion) ; but the whole
business was managed nzm'estatis quaestione ; and Silius antici-
pated conviction by suicide. In iv 21 Calpurnius Piso, accused
of a private conversation aduersum maiestatem, escapes condem—
nation by opportune death.

The scope of maiestas was extended by the pati-onage which
Tiberius afforded to the delatores. The phrase nomen deferre
is used several times in Cicero for ‘to accuse‚' ‘to inform
against) Also he uses delatio several times as a general term
for ‘accusation‚' ‘denunciation.’ In Silver Latin deferre is
used with accusative of person and genitive of charge; and
delator is often used for ‘informen' sometimes with genitive
of charge, as delator maiestatis (ii 50) and delator Papiae
lngz's (Suet. Nero 10). A quai-ter of the property of the con—
victed person went by law to the delatores (iv 20).

When Tiberius came to the throne, he regarded the system
of delatio as a useful engine for the enforcing of justice.
