unde dubitare...uacuum. Merivale (Romans under the Empz're,
c. 45) has some useful comments on this passage z—‘Tacitus‚ as
a disciple of the school of the fatalists, is constrained on this
occasion to enquire whether the favour or hostility of princes is a
matter of mere chance and destiny, or whether there may not
still be room for prudent counsel and good sense in the conduct
of human affairs; whether a secure path of life, however hard to
trace, might not still be discovered amidst the perils of the times,
between the extremes of rude independence and base servility.
The great defect of the Romans ot this period lay in their want of
the true self-respect which is engendered by the consciousness of
sober consistency. Bred in the speculative maxims of Greek and
Roman republicanism, they passed their manhood either in un-
learning the lessons of the sch001s‚ or in exaggerating them in a
spirit of senseless defiance.'
