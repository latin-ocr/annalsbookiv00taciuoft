x TACITUS, ANNALS IV

Nerva and Trajan, as he intended, he probably did not
survive the completion of the Annals. The His-tomes of
Tacitus, conipleted early in thc reign of Trajan, would have
covered thc period from the death of Nero to the accession of
Nerva,—abont 14 books iu all, of which 1-1v and part of v
are extant. The Annals were finished about 115 A.D. The
title of the work in the Medicean MS. is Cornelii Taciti ab
eoecessu dim· Auyustz‘. Tacitus calls it cmmales, because it is
arranged according to years. It consisted originally of 16 or
more books. VII—X are entirely lost, also parts of v, VI,
XI, ΧΠ. Books I—VI would have covered the reign of
Tiberius. VII would have begun that of Gaius (37 A.D.).
XI begins with the sixth year of Claudius (47 A.D.). XII
carries us to the end of Claudius <54 A.D.>. XIII—eud would
have given us the whole of Nero. XVI, as we have it, ceases
at 68 ΑΛ). Evidently the ambition of Tacitus was to cover
the whole period fron] the beginning of Augustus to the end
of Trajan.

ΙΙ. TACITUS AS A LITERARY ARTIST

‘All of thern profess great affection for letters3 it is one
way of justifying and ennobling their fortune. Not only have
they studied eloquence in their yonth3 to speak well is an
indispensable accomplishment for a Roman magistrate; but
they take an interest in philos‹5›phy or even compose elegies
and epics. I do not believe that in any other period has
literature been so greatly loved. Seneca even considers that
it is loved too much, and that people carry their taste for it
to the point of mania: litterarum intemperantia Zaboravms
(Epist. cvi 2). It was, in short, a very agreeable society,
which no longer had the distinction and high bearing of the
early days of the Empire, but in which were still to be found,
with a less spacious life and siinpler manners, much charm
and wit)
