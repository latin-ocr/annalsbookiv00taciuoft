xvi TACITUS, ANNALS IV

to defend the character and government of the Emperor,—a
good example of historical white-washing. We cannot do
more here than indicate some important points in the dis-
cussion. There seems to be no doubt that the attacks of
Tacitus 011 Tiberius are ovcrdonc.

In iv 6, Tacitus readily ascribes to Tiberius in his early
time a remarkable ideal of rigliteous government. Public
business and most important private affairs 1110 transacted in
the Senate. The Emperor acts admirably as the fountain of
honour. His appointments 1110 excellent: saa consulibus, sua
praetoribus speeies. The lesser magistrates also exercise their
proper functions.

It is in 23 A.D. that we coine (according to Tacitus) to
the turning—point in the reign of Tiberius—Tiberio rimati in
deterius principatus initium ille annus attulit (iv 7). These
words qualify what lias been said in the previous chapter.
The system there described was maintained till themurder
of the Emperor& son Drusus by the arch-traitor Sejanus.
Tiberius still preserves his ‹lignity especially in the striking
scene of the introduc-tion to the Senate of the boys Nero and
Drusus. He is determined (he says) to seek comfort e eom-
plexa rei publicae (iv 8). He still dwells on his alleged wish
to restore the old commonwealth. F or Tiberius’ dignity and
eloquence compare a later speech (iv 38).

The following words forin 11 lurid commentary on the
situation as conceived by Tacitus z—sed quia Seianus faei-
norum omnium repertor habebatur, ea: nimia caritate in eum
Caesaris et ceterorwn itt atramque odio quamuis fabulosa et
immania credebantur, atrociore sem per fama erya dominantium
exitus (iv ll).

Then, after Bury¹‚ we may note a special excuse for the
unhappy Emperor :—‘ Tiberius was now surrounded by four
imperial widows, who made his court 11 scene of perpetual
