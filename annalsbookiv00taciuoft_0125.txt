14. magnarum saepe rerum motus oriuntur, ‘great events
often take their rise.’ Cf. Aristotle's famous words, ’γίγνονται αἱ
στάσεις οὐ περὶ μικρῶν ἀλλ’ ἐκ μικρῶν (Politics V 4. l); also
Livy xxvii 9 ea· parnis rebus saepe maanarum momenta pendent.

Ramsay has some useful remarks on this chapter:—‘ Tacitus

does not appeal here to a high conception of history. He takes
the popular view that it reaches its highest interest in telling of

wars and conquests. Even the interest of such subjects as the
conflict between the Orders, and the battles over Agrai-ian and
other laws, does not consist in the fact that they raise great
constitutional questions, but that they give scope for picturesque
and stirring narrative. His own task is inglorious, because he
has no wars to tell of; and the climax in its dulness is that
Tiberius was what we should now call a Little Englander.⁷

constitution of his time is the best realisation of this ideal.

temperanter haberetur, ‘might be wisely controlled.' Tacitus
makes but a poor contribution to politica] philosophy. His one
idea is that we must study the nature and doings of the dominant
power in a state.
