ΟΝ OHAPTERS 25—27 87

triremes, from the Ravenna Fleet (see c. 5), told off to protect
trade in the Adriatic.

adpulere, ‘put into harbour‚⁷ i.e. at Brundisium. Cf. ii 24
triremis terram adpulit.

8. ad usus commeantium, ‘ for the requirements of traders.’

9. quaestor. From early times there appear to have been
four quaestors with spheres of duty (prouinciae) in Italy, chiefly
concerned with trade. One of these had the prouincia Ostiensis
charged with important duties with regard to the corn-supply.
Ashby in Recent Discoveries at Ostia, J. R. S. vol. ii, p. 155,
writesz—‘It seems probable, as Vaglieri and Carcopino have
conjectured independently, that the foundation of Ostia on its
present site may be connected with the institution of the four
quaestores classici in 267 B.C. and the assignment of one of them
to Ostia!

Another had the prouincia Gallica (i.e. Cisalpine Gaul). A
third was stationed in South Italy3 but we do not know the name
of his prouincia. Lipsius would read Cales euenerat here, and
thinks that this is the name of this prouincia. More probably
Brundisium was the station of this quaestor3 and, if calles is the
right reading, Ramsay thinks he may have had charge of ‘the
rough pasture-land of the interior' as well. Suetonius (Iulia-5 19)
speaks of proete'nciae minimi nessotii, hoc est siluae callesque. But
this passage has no reference to the prouinciae of the quaestors.

10. classiariorum, ‘marines‚’ i.e. from the biremes.

11. coeptantem cum maxime, ‘at the very beginning‚’ ‘just
as it was breaking out.⁷ Cf. iii 59 lacus cum maxime peragrantem
‘traversing at the very time.' The full expression would be
'nanc ut cum maxime [F.]. We have ‘nunc cum 'maaez'me ‘at this
moment' in Cicero and Livy, and tum cum rrzaxime ‘at that
moment’ in Livy. See Roby 1641.

13. tribunus, i.e. an officer of the praetorian guard.

15. familiarum, ‘households‚⁷ often, as here, in the sense of
‘ slave establishments.' Cf. iii 53 familiar-mn numerum et nationes.

gliscebat immensum, ‘was increasing enormously.' Cf. c. 5.
For the adverbial immensum (really a cognate acc.) cf. iii 30 domus
illa immenszwn uiyuit.
