ΙΝ TRODUCTION xxvii

Afterwards he saw its odious character and tried to check it
by instituting a special court of fifteen senators. Then he
relapsed owing to the evil infiuence of Sejanus 3 see Annals vi
throughout. There was no public prosecutor at Rome.
Hence it was convenient to have these private delatores,—
a term originally applied to those who gave inforniation in
respect of debts due to the exchequer. In an economic crisis,
which took place in 33 A.D., delatores made an attack on
money-lending capitalists, who set aside two laws of Julius
Caesar. Tacitus (vi 16) describes them as mayna uis accusa-
torum. Compare iv 36 ut quis destrictior accusator uelut
sacrosanctas erat.

In iv 30 we are told that it was proposed in the Senate
that rewards to delatores should be abolished in the case of
those found guilty of maiestas. Tiberius contra ‘morem suum
defends them as ‘guardiam' of justice. Tacitus' comment is :
sz'c delatores, glenus homimmz publico exitio repertum,...per
praemia efficiebantur. In iv 34 we read of a further stretch
in the employment of the law of maiestas. It is made to
reach Cremutius Cordus for a passage in a book, where the
eulogy is awarded to Cassius, which had once been spoken over
him by Brutus. We are told about Cordus’ trial, his eloquent
defence‚ and how he starved himself to death.

The following chapters are loci classici on the subject of
delatio and maiestas :—iv 21, 42, 66.
