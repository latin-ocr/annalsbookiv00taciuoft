xxii TACITUS, ANNALS IV

Tacitus, a champion of the Senate, writing of the early
part of the reign of Tiberius (iii 60), tells us how the Emperor,
while strengthening the powers of the Principate, yielded to the
Senate the seinblance of its ancient authority, by referring to
its discussion petitions from the Provinces.

A fine sight it was (writes Tacitus)—-ma9na eius diez· species
suic-to see the Senate inquil-ing into these matters, free as
111 olden days to cancel or wnfirin. But Tacitus knows that
this power is a mere phantom. There was no joint govern-
ment. It differed in no respect from monarchy,—7zon alia re
Romana quam si 111111.»- imperitet (iv 33).

There remained (acc‹‘›rding to 'Stobart¹) another motive
for admitting the Senate to partnership, a motive so simple
and practical that it almost eludes the notice of the constitu-
tional historian. Until a new machinery could be created,
until a competent civil service could be organised, the mere
burden of administration was more than one man could bear.
...... By degrees a civil service is organised. Then, as there
is less need of the Senate, its importance steadily decreases.
This 13 the explanation of the paradox that the more Augustus
seems to retire from pul ›lic offices, the more business is
absorbed into the imperial chancellery.

In iv 22, 34, 42, and other passages we find Tiberius pre—
siding at the senatorial high court of justice. The power of
pai-don has passed entirely to the Emperor. It is proposed
in the Senate (iv 30) that Serenus should be scourged to death
more maiorum. The Emperor exercises his power of inter-
03332702 ‚· and Serenus 13 banished.
