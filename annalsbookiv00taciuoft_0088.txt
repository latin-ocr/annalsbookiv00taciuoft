56 N OTES

7. potentia, undue influence; sometimes real power (c. 4, 41).

supra memoraui. N. refers to i 24, 69, iii 29, 35, 72.

8. quo facinore, i.e. the murder of Drusus.

raptum ierit, ‘ set out to seize.’ Cf. c. 66 perditum ire, c. 73
ultum ire. Notice also the frequent Silver Age use of the perf.
subj. as an aorist.

9. Vulsiniis. The modern name of Vulsinii is Bolsena.
Juvenal calls Sejanus Tuscus in x 74.

Seio Strabone equite Romano. Ramsay has a useful note :—
‘Velleius calls Sejanus princeps equestris ordinis (ii 127), and
ascribes to him consular brothers, cousins, and uncles. Thus
Sejanus was by no means the upstart that Tacitus would make
him out to be. His position was not unlike that of Maecenas,
very different from that of freedmen favourites of later emperors.³

10. Gaium caesarem, adopted in 17 Bc, when he was two
years old.

11. diui Augusti, often overdone in translation. ‘The
Emperor Augustus' is sufficient.

sectatus, ‘ having attached himself to.⁷

mox, ⁴ subsequently‚’ its usual meaning.

12. obscurum aduersum alios, ‘reserved towards others.’

14. isdem artibus, i.e. sollertia ‘cunning' ‘Sejanus‚ how-
ever wily, was at last no match for the superior wiliness of
Tiberius. He was hoist with his own petard’ [P.F.].

15. cuius...uiguit ceciditque, ‘on which he brought disaster
alike in his power and in his fall.’

pari exitio, sociative‚-—lit. ‘with equal tuin to which....’ Cf.
c, 30 publico exitio repertura.

16. laborum tolerans...su.i obtegens. Many present par-
ticiples take the genitive, especially in Tacitus. In this passage
he is evidently thinking of Sallust Catilina 5 corpuspatievns inediae
uiyiliae αῖῃονίε, supra quam cuiquam credibile est; animus audam...

17. iuxta, ‘side by side.'

18. compositus, either (1) ‘quiet' (as in line 2); or (2)
‘ assumed,' the common Tacitean meaning of the word. Perhaps
N. is right in thinking that the sense of artificiality is sufficiently
given by the contrast between palam and intus.
