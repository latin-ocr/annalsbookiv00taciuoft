15. seposuit Augustus. This verb is often used by Tacitus
of a mild type of exile. Merivale writes (c. 45) ε ‘ The treatment
of exiles seems generally to have been sufficiently mild. They
were allowed to a great extent the choice of locality; and when
Augustus forbade them to settle at any spot within 50 miles of
the continent, he excepted the pleasant retreats of Cos, Rhodes,
and Lesbos. He also confined them to a single ship of 1000
amphorae and two pinnaees for the voyage and conveyance of
their families, which further were limited to 20 slaves or freedmen.'

16. speeie studiorum. Marseilles was a noted home of Greek
