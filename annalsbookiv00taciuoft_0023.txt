INTRODUCTION xix

He arranged the long-standing difficulty of the throne of
Armenia, and converted the client-kingdoms of Cappadocia
and Commagene into Roman provinces. Then came a great
tragedy. Germanicus died at Antioch‚ the vic-tini, it was
said, of foul play on the part of his rival Piso, governor of
Syria. He stands out as a charming popular hero,—‘one of
the short—lived loves of the Roman people.‘ The death of his
son Drusus in 23 ΑΛ). was a very grievous blow to Tiberius.
Nothing was left but to adopt the two eldest sons of German—
icus Nero and Drusus. But his widow Agrippina was not
satisfied even with this proceeding, which marked out these
two princes as successors of Tiberius.

It is interesting to observe what vigorous language Tacitus
habitually ernploys in writing of the family of Germanicus:
e.g. iv 12 domum Germanici reuirescere occulti laetabantur:
and in the same chapter, pudicitia Aqrippinae impenetrabili ,·
and again, ut superbam fecunditate, subnixam popularibus
studiis inhiare dominationi apud Caesarem arguerent. Com-
pare also iv 15, referring to Nero, recenti memoria Germanici
illum aspici, illum azidiri *rebantum also iv 17, 18, 193 and
52 Ayrippina semper atrox. Compare 53 peruicax irae, and
the rest of the chapter.

The turning-point in the history comes when Sejanus
proposes to marry the younger Livia (Livilla). Foiled in
this by Tiberius, he makes up his mind to destroy the house
of Germanicus.
