“Dr Sandys and his collaborators have produced a notable book of
reference, within a manageaole compass....The work appears to have
been done extremely well, and the immense amount of information ς

presented tersely and intelligibly....The illustrations are good and
adequate.’'—J0urnal of Helleni( Stndz'es

“A useful and erudite work, which represents the best results ot
Latin scholarship, and whose bibliographies will be found invaluable to
students. The scope os the book is wide. There is no side of in-
tellectual‚ political or administrative life upon which it does not touch.
Ethnology, public antiquities‚ private antiquities, the army, the arts
and literature all have their place in this Classical encyclopaedia‚ whose
full indexes make it an admirable work of refe1·ence....We cannot repay
the debt we owe to the Romans otherwise than by a loyal understanding
of their history and their literature, and to those who ask a guide we
can commend no surer one than this widely planned‚ well exeeuted
Companz'on of Dr Sandys.’⁷—Obsem¹er

“In the single volume before us it is really possible sor the first time
to obtain a conspectus of almost all that is definitely known about
Roman environment‚ life, and thought....The Book is a thesaurus of
sane learning in a readable form. Varro or Pliny or St Isidore of
Seville would have studied it with a growing wonder and enlighten-
ment3 for not Rome only, but the history of all knowledge about Rome,
is here recalled to its first beginningS.⁷’— Times

“This volume is a complete cyclopaedia or Roman studies; and in
nearly 900 pages and half a million words contains the carefully adjusted
result of recent inquiries into every department of Latin lore. It is, in
a very remarkable degree, accurate, complete and abreast of modern
discovery; and we congratulate the University‚ the contributors, and
the editor on the signal success of an ambitious project.’'

Saturday Revz‘ew

“This book gives ns a niasterly brief sui-vey of the antiquities and
