IN TRODUCTION xxv

Suetonius: ‘It is the part of a good shepherd to shear his
sheep, not to flay them.>

The following chapters in Book IV are also important sor
the history of provincial management‚—†23-26, 43, 44, 46—51,
72-74.

This passage from Tiberius tlte Tyr-ant (p. 380) is useful :—
‘Tiberius treated the Senate with formal respect, and did his
best to make it worthy of its opportunities. If he could
have avoided interfering with its administration of its own
provinces, he would have done sc. Tiberius, like Augustus,
supplied himself with an inner Council of the Senate ; and it
is possible that on most occasions the inner Council repre-
sented the whole body> But lie did not restriot himself to
Senatorial counsellors ; and we are told that, in dealing with
provincial questions, he was always careful to provide himself
with the expert evidence of men who knew the localities
concerned. The Senate was cnriously indifferent to muni-
cipal matters. The rank of senator eventually became little
more than an honourable distinction. The difference between
Senatorial and Imperial Provinces did not last long, the
Imperial administration proving better suited to the needs of
the Empire.’

VIII. MAIESTAS

Maiestas populi Romani and maiestatem minuere or laedere
are phrases belonging to Republioan Rome. Cicero (de
inuentz'one ii 53) gives this definitionz—maiestatem minuere
est de diym'tate aut amplitudine aut potestate populi aut
eorum, quibus populus potestatem dedit, aliquid cleroqare.
Compare Verres ii 88 crimen maiestatis, ‘charge of treason,’
and pro Cluentio 97 Zeyz'onem sollicitare res est quae {eye
maiestatis tenetur. The scope of maiestas was strictly defined
by a law of Julius Caesar. It was extended by Augustus3
but he made little use of it.
