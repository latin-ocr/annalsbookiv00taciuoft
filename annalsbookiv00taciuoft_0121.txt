ΟΝ GHAPTERS 28, 29 89

4. senectutis extremae...defecto corpore. Note how fond
Tacitus is of linking together dissimilar eonstructions.

5. turbandae rei publicae accerserentur, ‘accused of dis-
turbing the commonwealth.’

6. exempti, ‘ released from the charge.7

in patrem ex seruis quaesitum, ⁴ the slaves were examined (by
toi-ture) for evidence against the father)

7. quaestio. Cicero (pro Sulla 76) uses quaestiones et tormenta
for ‘ examination by torture.³

8. rumore, ‘murmurs.' Cf. xiv 11 aduerso rumore, iii 29
secundo rumore.

uulgi...minitantium‚ a sense construction.

robur, i.e. the Carcer or Tullianum at the foot of the Capitol,
in which criminals were strangled. See iii 50 rneque carcer neque
laqueus3 Hor. Ocles ii 13 catenas et Italum r0bur3 Lucr. iii 1017
uerbera carnifices robam Livy xxxviii 59 in robore et tenebris
exspirem and the description in Sallust Cat. 55. The following
explanation of the term is quoted from Paullus: robus in carcere
dicitur is locus, quo praecipitatur 'rnaleflcorum yemis, quod ante
arcis robusteis inclmlebatur.

9. saxum, the Tarpeian rock, on the west side of the Capitol.
Cf. ii 32 saxo deiectus. The full expression saxum Tarpeium is
given in vi 19.

parricidarum poenas. A good locus classicus on this subject
is Cicero pro Rosc. Amer. 70-73. Cf. Digest 48-9, parricida uiryis
sanquineis uerberatus, deinde culleo insuam-r cum cane, yallo
gallinaceo et uipera et simia. deinde rin mare profundum culleus
iactetur. If there is no sea near, then, according to Hadrian's
ordinance, he is to be thrown to wild beasts. Note that par-
ricidium includes the murder of any near relation. Nero is the
arch—parricide in Roman literature. He deserved not once, but
many times to die the parricide's death, as Juvenal says (viii
213, 4):

cuins supplicio non debuit una parari
simia nec serpens unus nee culleus unus.

A bag was hung round the neck of one of Nero's statues with
the inscription: eqo quid potui? secl ῖιι culleum meruisti (Suet.).
