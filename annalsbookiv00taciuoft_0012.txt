viii TACITUS, ANNALs IV

Vespasian‚ advanced by Titus, and carried still further by
Domitian' (H ist. i 1). This means that he was a candidatus
Caesaris in his magistracies ¹. He began his carcer as military
tribune under Vespasian. Under Titus lic was quaestor.
Under Domitian he would have become either tribune 01·
aedile ; for under the Empire the tribunate of thc plebs
might be held as a substitute for the aedileship in the
career of honores. In 88 116 became praetor. He was now
about 33. For a 'nouus homo, he had come to the front
rapidly. As a protege of three Emperors, he was by necessity
a partisan of the imperial regime.

Till the year 88 A.D. wc may suppose that Tacitus lived in
Rome, (i) engaged in his practice at the bar ; for the younger
Pliny speaks of his eminence there, and (ii) perhaps already
gathering materials for his historical works. From 89 A.D.,
i.e. immediately after his praetorship, till 93 he probably
held a provincial command as legatus pro praetore. We may
conjecture that it was now that Tacitus gained the knowledge
necessary for the writing of his Germania. The only imperial
province governed by an ex-praetor in the vicinity of Germany
was Belgic Gaul. Almost certainly it was there that he spent
the four years of his absence from the City. During the last
three years of Domitian he was in Rome. The accession of
Nerva in 96 was a wonderful relief to all good men : he joined
together two elements previously hard to unite, principatus
and libertas.

In 97 Tacitus was eoozsul suffectus (after the death of
Verginius Rufus) and colleaguc in the consulship with
Nerva himself. It was about this time that Tacitus wrote
the life of his father-in-law Agricola. In the same year (98)
he published the Germania, in which he contrasts the native
simplicity of the Germans with the vices of imperial civili-
