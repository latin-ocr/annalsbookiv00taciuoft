1. flamine Diali. Some extracts from Warde Fowler's Re-
liyious Experience of the Roman People will form a useful
eommentary on some points in this chapter. He gives a long
list of taboos or disabilities to which the Priest of Jupiter was
even in historieal times subject. He was forbidden to touch a
dog, a goat, raw meat, etc„ eto. He might not walk under
a vine (p. 34). The Flamen was a survival of those magician-
kings who make rain and do other useful things, but would lose

y their power if they were exposed to certain eontingencieS. The

number of possible eontingencies inore-ases till the unfortunate
owner of the powers becomes powerless by virtue of the care so
painfully taken of him (p. 108).

Warde Fowler illustrates this by a ⁶ most extraordinary story ’
from Livy (xxvii 8). In 209 Rc. C. Valerius Flaccus, the black
sheep of a great family, was inaugurated against his will as
Flamen Dialis by the Pontifex Maximus, P. Licinius. Livy
expressly tells us that it was ob adulescentiam 71e9le9e⁷ztem
luxuriosamquffi and it is pretty plain that the step was sug-
gested by the relations to keep him out of mischief. For
the disabilities on this ancient priesthood were, as we have seen,
numerous and striet: and among the restrictions laid on its
holder was one which forbade him to leave his house for a single
night (p. 342). The strange thing in the case of Flaccus is that
this office had such a wholesome disciplinary effect that the
libertine became a model youth, the admiration of his own and
other families (p. 343). See however note on line 13 (below).

2. roganda noua lege, ‘a proposal of a change in the law-,³
Tacitus not unfrequently speaks of the passing of leyes. Cf.
lines 12 and 16. Their enactment by the comitia must have been
purely formal.
