Press Notices

“This work is a kind of encyclopaedia in minimo. ...The amount of
information gathered into seven hundred pages is a marvel....And‚
strange to say, the book is quite pleasant to read in spite of its in-
numerable facts. The printing is admjrable and the volume is well
illustrated....Mr Whibley is to be congratulated on his book. The
country can produce 3 body of scholars as earesul as the Germans...and
their judginent is notably sane.”—Gna2·dscm

“The scheme of the book is good. It is not a mere collection of
interesting miscellanea, but a clear and connected account of Greek life
and thought, written by scholars who are intimately acquainted with all
the latest developments of the subject....The mass of erudition that is
packed between its covers is astonishing....1t is thorough in the sense
that, in the majority of the articles, at least. the substance of our know-
ledge is given, the essential points are touched upon, and the theories of
first-rate importance are concisely statedfi—Saturday lx’eview

“It is a handbook that no one will be ashamed to own and consult,
a handbook that will be sure to fill a place not only in libraries designed
sor the young, but also on the desk of the teacher‚ and on the shelves

of the scholar....1t is 3 good book worthy of English scholarship.'’
Journal qf Educatz'on

“The completeuess of the scope is obvious. The excellence of the
work is guaranteed by the names of the contributors. The volume
should be on the Greek library shelves of every school where Greek is
seriously taught. Not for reference merely ; it will be read with avidity,
apart froin task-work‚ by any boy that has the root of the matter in him.
The book is beautifully p1inted and produced.'’—Educatz'onal Times

“This is an admirable book⁷ in design and execution alike....The
choice of writers is above reproach....Secoudlyu the choice of matters is

. good. ...Thirdly, the book is readable: it is not merely a work of refer-

ence. ...The pages are full os illustrations from art, lx'ealien, inscriptions,
manuscripts; the printing is worthy of the Press3 and the whole book
is good to look upon.'’—Caml³7'1‘dgc lx'ez'icw
