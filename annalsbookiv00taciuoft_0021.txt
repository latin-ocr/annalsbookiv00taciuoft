jealousy and intr-igue. There was his mother Livia and
his daughter—in-law Livilla, his sister-in—law Antonia, and
Agrippina. The will of Augustus had left Livia a share in
the supreme power, and she desired to exert it.'

It is important to notice that even at Capri Tiberius gave
strict attention to the details of state business ; and he was
in constant communication with the senate. Bury suggests
that, by his retirement, ‘he may have wished to give Nero,
the eldest son of Germanicus, a chance of gradually taking an
active part in the governmcntand of rendering the assistance
which he had himself given to Augustus)

In iv 67, Tacitus tells us that the Emperor objected so
strongly to town life‚-indeed to the mainland as a whole,
that he buried himself in Capri3 its solitude being its main
attraction for him. These words, as Ramsay remarks, imply
a morbid shrinking from the public view, which would
account for the retirement to Capri without calling for the
grosser insinuations of iv 57, where it is alleged that the
island rocks were the screen of licentiousness. Others, ac—
cording to Tacitus, said he wished to conceal the deformities
of old age. Others held that, as we have mentioned above,
he had been driven away by his mother’s imperious temper.

This is Tiberius' last phase as conceived by Tacitus in a
later bookz—postremo z'n scelera simul ac dedecoret. prorupit,
postquam remoto pudore et metu sno tantum z‘nyem'o utebatur
(vi 51). Compare vi 48 ui dominationis conuulsns et mutatus
sit. Ramsay is doubtless right when, following Tarver, he
says: ‘Intellectually and morally he stood head and shoulders
above the evil emperors of the first century. Tacitus visited
upon him the sins of the worst of his successors.'
