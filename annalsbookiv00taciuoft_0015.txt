In these glowing words Bois-sier (p. 19) describes the society
in which the young Tacitus grew up. We must think of him
first as a student of oratory. He tells us in 1110 Βίαῖο9αο
(c. ΞΟ), how not only the juryman, but also the chance 110101101-
in court demands a bright and beautiful style of oratory.
‘Young students also, who follow orators with a view to their
own advancelnent, not only want tc hear, but also to carry
home something brilliant and memorable. They pass such
things round their own circle and often send them in letters
to their colonies and provinces, whether some smart and

Seneca gives us several declamation passages which are merely
prose paraphrases of Virgil, and the declamation on the poor man’s
bees makes much use of the fourth Georgic. Even the loss of the
Ciceronian and Livian period he ascribes to the same cause,
quoting the words of Quintilian: ‘Nowadays we expect something
effective at the end of every sentence, and look upon it as almost
a sin to take breath where we are not likely to get applause.'
