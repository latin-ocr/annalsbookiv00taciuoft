PREFAOE

HE Fourth Book of the Annals is an excellent,
introduction to Silver Age Latin and to the
history of the early Principate3 and altogether ib
is a most sbirnulating subject, as I found from
reading it with Dr Butler in the Sixth Form ab
Harrow in 1874. Little did I then think that
more than ‘forty years on' I should receive from
the Syndics of the Press a request to edit, this
book in their Series. There are many books of
various kinds ‘oo help bhe editor of Tacitus in his
work. Ι am especially indebted bo Nipperdey,

Halm, Fame-aux, Boissier, and Ramsay.
