INTRODUCTION

I. LIFE AND WRITINGS OF TACITUS

Cornelius Tacitus perhaps belonged to an equestrian
family of Interamna in Umbria. He was born about
54 A.D. His praenomen is uncertain ; possibly it was
Publius. According to the elder Pliny, either his father or
uncle administered the revenues of Belgio Gaul.

The Dialogus de oratoribus generally ascribed to Tacitus,
was probably written in the early years of the reign of
Domitian, i.e. 81 ΑΛ). or laterl. The dramatic date is
74-75 A.D., i.e. when Tacitus was about twenty, admodum
iuuenis, as he describes himself. The treatise is a criticism
of the rhetorical curriculum of his boyhood, —an explanation
of the decline of oratory under the Empire. The interlo-
cutors are Julius Secundus and other celebrated rhetoricians.
Marcus Aper champions the school of Seneca. According to
Boissier2‚ Messalla, the man of action and student combined,
represents Tacitus himself.

In 78 ΑΒ. Tacitus married the daughter of Julius Agricola,
already a prominent man at Rome, and consul in the previous
year. Agricola left Rome to be propraetor of Britain, as
successor to Frontinus. Tacitus wrote his life (or historical
eulogy) probably in 98 A.D.

Tacitus sums up his public life in these words :—‘ I should
acknowledge that my politica] career was inaugurated by
